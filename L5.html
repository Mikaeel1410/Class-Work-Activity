                    <h1> Facts About Dogs </h1>
                    <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 20,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.

                    <p>Smell is a dog's most prominent sense and the one that is the most different from ours. It has been estimated that a dog's sense of smell is 100,000 times more powerful than a human's. Scientists think that dogs have about 2 billion olfactory receptors—many, many more than our 40 million.
